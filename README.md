NIDE is an IDE for the OpenComputers mod.
I started this project a few months ago, but haven't had a lot of time to work on it, so i decided to just publish the github repo already and let the community make commits.


TODO
--------------------------
I have created a Trello board showing the current status / progress of NIDE and what features are planned on getting added.
If anyone wants to give a shot to any of these to-do's, go ahead!

Running NIDE's latest version on OpenComputers
--------------------------
Just copy and paste this command and run it:
`pastebin run GT9QzG3z`

Running your own version of NIDE
--------------------------
For this you have multiple options:
1. Just upload it to pastebin and run the code
2. Paste the file directly into the computer through windows file explorer(for this: saves => your world => opencomputers => select the right computer and paste the file into that folder)
3. Program to let you download code from github(currently unavailable; will get readded soon)

# With everything being said now: good luck and have fun!
